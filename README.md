# Motion-sensor
# Intro
This GitHub page details a project done by Daniel Arinze as part of the completion of GPGN590A at the Colorado School of Mines, Fall 2024. Herein I discuss the creation of a low-cost, motion sensor using Arduino boards and code. Code is found in Sensor.ino. May this page be a reference to those who come after.
# Why make a motion sensor ?
Asides from being cool, motion sensors are applicable in field surveys that involve leaving equipment in the field and at the mercy of criters such as field mice and birds. This motion sensor is equiped with a buzzer to scare off creatures that come too close to the set up. The set up is relatively affordable and the challenge of assembling the pieces together is entertaining.
