# Motion-sensor
# Intro
This GitHub page details a project done by Daniel Arinze as part of the completion of GPGN590A at the Colorado School of Mines, Fall 2024. Herein I discuss the creation of a low-cost, motion sensor using Arduino boards and code. Code is found in Sensor.ino. May this page be a reference to those who come after.
